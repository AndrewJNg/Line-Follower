Uses 2 motors to show examples of the functions in the library.  This causes
a robot to do a little 'jig'.  Each movement has an equal and opposite movement
so assuming your motors are balanced the bot should end up at the same place it
started.

Development environment specifics:
Developed on Arduino 1.6.4
Developed with ROB-9457

// This is the library for the TB6612 that contains the class Motor and all the
// functions
#include <SparkFun_TB6612.h>

// Pins for all inputs, keep in mind the PWM defines must be on PWM pins
// the default pins listed are the ones used on the Redbot (ROB-12097) with
// the exception of STBY which the Redbot controls with a physical switch
#define PWMA 5
#define AIN2 6
#define AIN1 7
#define STBY 8
#define BIN1 9//motor
#define BIN2 10
#define PWMB 11 

// these constants are used to allow you to make your motor configuration 
// line up with function names like forward.  Value can be 1 or -1
const int offsetA = 1;
const int offsetB = 1;

// Initializing motors.  The library will allow you to initialize as many
// motors as you have memory for.  If you are using functions like forward
// that take 2 motors as arguements you can either write new functions or
// call the function more than once.
Motor motor1 = Motor(AIN1, AIN2, PWMA, offsetA, STBY);
Motor motor2 = Motor(BIN1, BIN2, PWMB, offsetB, STBY);

void setup()
{
 //Nothing here
}


void loop()
{
   //Use of the drive function which takes as arguements the speed
   //and optional duration.  A negative speed will cause it to go
   //backwards.  Speed can be from -255 to 255.  Also use of the 
   //brake function which takes no arguements.
   motor1.drive(255,000);
